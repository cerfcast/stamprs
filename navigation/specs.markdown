## STAMP Specifications

The IPPM working group of the IETF is currently the body where _most_ of the work specifying STAMP is being done. The base STAMP is specified in [RFC 8762](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8762/). Support for extensions was added with [RFC 8972](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8972/).

| RFC | Title | URL |
| -- | -- | -- |
| RFC 8762 | Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol | [URL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8762/) |
| RFC 8972 | Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol Optional Extensions | [URL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8972/) |


### STAMP Extensions

The base features of STAMP are powerful. However, those features are just the beginning of what measurements STAMP can make. RFC 8972 enabled Optional extensions to the STAMP protocol that give STAMP even more power and flexibility. Below is a list of the RFCs where STAMP extensions are _already_ standardized.

| RFC | Title | URL | Description | TLV(s) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| RFC 8972 | Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol Optional Extensions | [URL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8972/) | In addition to specifying the means for extending STAMP to allow additional, optional functionality, RFC 8972 also specified several extensions. | XXXX |
| RFC 9503 | Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) Extensions for Segment Routing Networks | [URL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9503/) | This RFC (Proposed Standard) specifies optional extensions to STAMP for measurements in networks with segment routing. | Destination Node Address, Return Path |
